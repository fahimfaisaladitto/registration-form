# Project Structure
<h4 align="left">The project is organized into three separate files for clean code and easy maintenance.</h4>

• index.html: Contains the core HTML structure of the web application and links to the external CSS and JavaScript files.

• style.css: Holds all the custom CSS, including theme variables for light/dark modes, animations, and component-specific styles.

• script.js: Contains all the JavaScript code that drives the application's functionality, from handling user input to managing form validation.

# Setup and Installation

• Clone or Download: Get a copy of all three files (index.html, style.css, and script.js).

• Keep Files Together: Ensure that all three files are located in the same folder or directory.

• Open in Browser: Right-click the index.html file and choose "Open with" your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
